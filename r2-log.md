# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Round 2

### Day 0: 
R2/D0. I've decided it's time to start my next round of #100DaysOfCode. During this round, I want to do the #freeCodeCamp Information Security & Quality Assurance certification, work up to 3kyu on #codewar and build my own free stack application. I can't wait to get started! 

### Day 1:
R2/D1 #100DaysOfCode
Had a great first day of my 2nd round
● Hosted a 2nd #HourofCode with the other 4th grade class (so much fun!)
● Figured out the parsing portion of a 2kyu #codewar kata I've been working on
● Completed the InfoSec Helmet & BCrypt lessons on #freeCodeCamp

### Day 2:
R2/D2 #100DaysOfCode 
Today I started learning about QA testing with mocha & chai (coincidentally while drinking some chai ☕️😁). Got through 20/24 of the #freeCodeCamp exercises in this section.

### Day 3:
R2/D3 #100DaysOfCode
Finished the mocha & chai exercises on #freeCodeCamp. I'm tempted to continue plowing through the rest of the exercises, but I feel like I need to go back, read some more documentation, and take some notes. I'm not fully grasping the syntax and concepts yet.

### Day 4: 
R2/D4 #100DaysOfCode
Finished reviewing and taking notes on mocha & chai. Started the #freeCodeCamp Metric-Imperial Converter project since I've covered enough to implement that one. Looks like it will be fun and should help cement what I've learned so far on this certification.

### Day 5:
R2/D5 #100DaysOfCode
Worked on the #freeCodeCamp Metric Imperial converter project. Implemented a lot of the logic for parsing the input, and a few of the tests with chai. Also wrapped up a really fun project at work where I got to solve a big challenge with SQL and Autohotkey

### Day 6:
R2/D6 #100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp
Improved the input parsing and got a few more tests passing on the Metric Imperial converter project. Also played some Code Combat for the first time with my 9yo daughter this morning. I'm happy to say she enjoyed it almost as much as me😁

### Day 7:
R2/D7 #100DaysOfCode
Didn't have a lot of time to code today with all the presents to wrap, but I did get to work on the Metric Imperial converter a little this morning. Improved the error handling and got a couple more tests to pass. 

Merry Christmas & happy coding! 🎅🎄

### Day 8:
R2/D8 #100DaysOfCode
Implemented the functional chai tests on the Metric Imperial Converter. Improved the regex for parsing the number input some more. All my tests are finally passing. Now I'm trying to get all the #freeCodeCamp tests to pass (using community-developed tests)

### Day 10: 
R2/D10 #100DaysOfCode
Got started on my next #freeCodeCamp project, the Issue Tracker. Got all the packages and Mongo DB set up. Tried multiple ways to add an express route only once the db connected, but couldn't get it. Finally had to give in and leave it for tomorrow😌

### Day 11:
R2/D11 #100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp
Got MongoDB connected on my Issue Tracker. Implemented saving new issues to the database and retrieving via GET request. Got 5 of the FCC tests passing. Glad to end the year with a productive coding session😊 Happy New Year everyone! 🎉🥳

### Day 12:
R2/D12 #100DaysOfCode
Implemented the express routes for modifying, deleting, and filtering issues on the #freeCodeCamp Issue Tracker project. Got 5 more FCC tests passing. Man I love the feeling I get after a productive coding session!😁o

![10 FCC tests passing on the Issue Tracker](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ENUOwu2WkAA4Jna?format=png&name=small)

### Day 13:
R2/D13 #100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp
Wrote all the functional chai tests and got the last 5 FCC tests to pass on my Issue Tracker. Just need to do a little polishing and I'll be done with this one 😁

![All FCC tests passing on the Issue Tracker](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ENZY5wJX0AAEhEo?format=png&name=small)

### Day 14:
R2/D14 #100DaysOfCode
Polished up and submitted my #freeCodeCamp Issue Tracker project. 2 down, 3 to go on my Info Security & QA certification😊

![2 of 5 projects done](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ENenRCOXUAM9pMp?format=png&name=small)

### Day 15:
R2/D15 #100DaysOfCode
Got a good start on my next #freeCodeCamp project, the Personal Library. Set up the Glitch project, the MongoDB, and implemented express routes for posting and getting books. Got the first 4 of the FCC tests to pass.

### Day 16:
R2/D16 #100DaysOfCode 
Finished implementing the post, get, and delete routes for the #freeCodeCamp Personal Library project and got all the related tests to pass (10/16 so far). Learned how to hide fields (like \_\_v) returned by mongoose in JSON.

### Day 17:
R2/D17 #100DaysOfCode
I'm getting much better at coding functional tests with chai thanks to all the repetition. Today I implemented all the functional tests, got all the FCC tests to pass, and finished the #freeCodeCamp Personal Library project. 3 down 2 more to go😁

### Day 18:
R2/D18 #100DaysOfCode
Got started on the #freeCodeCamp Stock Checker app. Learned how to use composite unique indexes to prevent duplicates in MongoDB. Got 4/6 of the tests to pass. This one's pretty interesting - combining a db with an existing API to track likes.

![4 FCC tests passing on the Stock Checker](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EN4RSrHWAAAFc-Z?format=png&name=small)

### Day 19:
R2/D19 #100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp
Spent a lot of time today trying to understand how to handle db errors. Learned how to set up error-handling middleware and catch, modify, and re-throw errors to parent functions. My code seems much more graceful and less repetitive now 😎

### Day 20:
R2/D20 #100DaysOfCode 
Implemented the comparison functionality and all of the functional tests on my Stock Checker #freeCodeCamp app. Got 5 out of 6 of the FCC tests to pass, but I'm not sure why the 6th one won't. I'll have to dig into it more tomorrow 😕

![5 FCC tests passing on the Stock Checker](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EOCn6YDXsAAzBGI?format=png&name=small)

### Day 21:
R2/D21
Got the stomach bug yesterday😔, but managed to work on the error in the FCC Backend Tester. Found and fixed several bugs and got all the Stock Checker tests to pass! It was a great experience working on someone else's code for the first time
\#100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp

### Day 22:
R2/D22
Finished up and submitted the Stock Price Checker app. 4 down, only 1 to go! Started going through the remaining Advanced Node & Express exercises on FCC before I tackle the last project.

### Day 23:
R2/D23
Worked through more of the authentication exercises and started this excellent video by @traversymedia, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FOq4cUdH8k&t=3547s which made it so much easier to understand. Getting excited about being able to implement authentication in my apps.
\#100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp

### Day 24:
R2/D24
Spent an hour trying to get the GitHub authentication exercises to pass on #freeCodeCamp, only to figure out I was supposed to use a different boilerplate, not make all these unnecessary changes to my current one!😬 
\#100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp

### Day 25:
R2/D25
Got the social authentication challenges to complete (thanks to using the right boilerplate this time)! Learned how to look up the assertions for the FCC tests in GitHub, and fixed a couple tests that weren't passing. Started socket exercises.
\#100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp

### Day 26:
R2/D26
Went back and polished up my Random Quote Machine project and shared it with friends on Facebook. I'd love to create more apps as I'm learning that friends & family will find useful. Anyone have any suggestions or tips on doing that?
\#100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp

### Day 27:
R2/D27
Finished up the socket-io exercises on #freeCodeCamp. It was pretty cool learning how to build a little chat app using sockets. Started building the last of the 5 projects for the InfoSec & QA certification projects - the message board.
\#100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp

### Day 28:
R2/D28
Got the db, first route, and 4 tests working on the Message Board project. I've been looking into some cool #CodeForGood sites. Think I might sign up for this one, which looks cool: https://www.agileventures.org/. Anyone have any experience with it?
\#100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp

### Day 29:
R2/D29
Finished implementing the GET and POST routes for the Message Board app. Got the first 7 tests to pass. Learned how to limit the number of subdocuments returned and also exclude certain fields from them in mongoose. Really enjoying the backend!
\#100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp

### Day 30:
R2/D30
Implemented the PUT and DELETE routes to update and delete threads and replies on the Message Board app. Now passing 15/16 tests. All that's left is to implement the functional tests tomorrow😀
\#100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp

### Day 31
R2/31
Implemented functional tests using mocha & chai for the 'thread' routes of my #freeCodeCamp Message Board project. Now all I have left is to do a similar set of tests for the 'replies' route tomorrow and I should be about done with this one! 
\#100DaysOfCode

### Day 32
R2/D32
Finished up the Message Board app today, the last of the 5 projects, and claimed the Information Security & QA certification!🎉

That's 5 of the #freeCodeCamp certifications down. Now I just have the data viz cert left to complete the full-stack😁

### Day 33
R2/D33 
Not much coding this weekend, but I attended an excellent #MLHBuildEvent hosted by @JKim_Tran and @dana7160. It was super inspiring to hear from past #hackathon winners and I worked up the courage to sign up for @hackupstate, my first hackathon in April😁
\#100DaysOfCode

### Day 34
R2/D34
Submitted my first PR today😁 There were a couple things I had trouble with in the #freeCodeCamp curriculum for the last cert, so I thought it'd be a good opportunity to contribute to open source. It was easier than I thought; I just hope it'll be approved🤞

### Day 35
R2/D35
Completed the 3kyu Battleship Field Validator kata on @codewars and got up to 600 honor points😊
https://www.codewars.com/kata/52bb6539a4cf1b12d90005b7
\#100DaysOfCode

Learned the difference between "for...in" and "for...of" syntax in JavaScript:

```
// use "for...in" to loop through properties IN objects
for (let property in object) { ... }

// use "for..of" to loop through elements OF arrays or strings 
for (let element of array) { ... }
```

### Day 36
R2/D36
Worked on a 2kyu #codewars kata I've been thinking about for a while - Evaluate Mathematical Equations (https://www.codewars.com/kata/52a78825cdfc2cfc87000005). It passes all but 3 of the tests, so close! I'm sure I'll be obsessing about how to fix it in my sleep tonight 😌
\#100DaysOfCode

### Day 37
R2/D37
I improved my solution from yesterday, completed my first 2kyu kata and earned 129 honor points on @codewars today! These things are so addicting - I can't stop thinking about them until they're solved, and it's such a good feeling when I finish one😄

### Day 38
R2/D38
Started brainstorming and designing my first full stack app. I've built a lot of projects for #freeCodeCamp, but this will be the first of my own design. It's both exciting and a little bit scary 😅
\#100DaysOfCode

### Day 39
R2/D39
Started work on my first full stack app - a random family conversation starters app. It's so nice working in VS Code after doing the last 10 projects for #freeCodeCamp on Glitch. Started from scratch, got Express, mongoDB, and the first couple routes set up.
\#100DaysOfCode

Used this excellent tutorial by @traversymedia to help set up the files and imports for my app, an area I still need more practice in after doing the freeCodeCamp Node projects.

\#100DaysOfCode

### Day 40
R2/D40
Tried to update my PR for the freeCodeCamp curriculum and accidentally reset my local branch with the fix 😬 Realizing I have much more to learn about git!

Did some more planning on my conversation starter app. Trying not to go crazy yet with the features

\#100DaysOfCode

### Day 41
R2/D41
Did a little more design work on my conversation starter app, implemented another route, and refactored some of the mongoose code. I'm not sure whether it's best to use Promise (.then/.catch) or await/async syntax with mongoose. What are your thoughts?
\#100DaysOfCode

### Day 42
R2/D42
My first ever pull request was approved & merged! 🥳 I added a fix to the #freeCodeCamp InfoSec & QA curriculum to make it more clear where you need to switch to the new boilerplate projects. Feels great to have made my first #opensource contribution!
\#100DaysOfCode

Researched how to set up one-to-many relationships in #MongoDB. Finally came up with a schema for my conversation starter app that I'm happy with 🤓 Decided to use two collections with the conversation prompts containing a reference to their parent category.
\#100DaysOfCode

### Day 43
R2/D43
Implemented an express route to return a random prompt on my conversation starter app. Took a lot longer than I thought it would, but I learned about #MongoDB aggregations (like sample, unwind, & project). Feel like I need a whole class on that topic 🥴 
\#100DaysOfCode

### Day 44
R2/D44
Refactored my #MongoDB code for retrieving a random conversation starter using countDocuments and skip. Turned out to be a lot harder than I thought to retrieve a random document! Now it's on to the front-end. Hoping I still remember React! 😅 
\#100DaysOfCode

### Day 45
R2/D45
Started on the frontend of my conversation starter app. Set up reactstrap and the navbar components. I really loved all the backend projects, but I'm also excited to get back into React again. It's even cooler now that I'll be connecting to my own API 😀
\#100DaysOfCode

### Day 46
R2/D46
I was worried I'd be really rusty at #reactjs after spending a couple months learning the back-end, but it's all coming back to me now 😀 Got the navbar, category-selection dropdown, and associated state set up. Really enjoying reactstrap.
\#100DaysOfCode

### Day 47
R2/D47
Got the first draft of the front end done in #reactjs and reactstrap. Trying to keep the interface as simple as possible. Now I just need to connect it to the back end and make it look a little more interesting 😅
\#100DaysOfCode

### Day 48
R2/D48
Got the #reactjs front-end of my conversation starter app connected to the back-end to pull in the categories and prompts. I've got to say, it feels pretty awesome seeing it starting to come together and actually pulling in data from my own API 😁
