# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Round 2

### Day 0: 
R2/D0. I've decided it's time to start my next round of #100DaysOfCode. During this round, I want to do the #freeCodeCamp Information Security & Quality Assurance certification, work up to 3kyu on #codewar and build my own free stack application. I can't wait to get started!
