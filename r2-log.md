# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Round 2

### Day 0: 
R2/D0. I've decided it's time to start my next round of #100DaysOfCode. During this round, I want to do the #freeCodeCamp Information Security & Quality Assurance certification, work up to 3kyu on #codewar and build my own free stack application. I can't wait to get started! 

### Day 1:
R2/D1 #100DaysOfCode
Had a great first day of my 2nd round
● Hosted a 2nd #HourofCode with the other 4th grade class (so much fun!)
● Figured out the parsing portion of a 2kyu #codewar kata I've been working on
● Completed the InfoSec Helmet & BCrypt lessons on #freeCodeCamp

### Day 2:
R2/D2 #100DaysOfCode 
Today I started learning about QA testing with mocha & chai (coincidentally while drinking some chai ☕️😁). Got through 20/24 of the #freeCodeCamp exercises in this section.

### Day 3:
R2/D3 #100DaysOfCode
Finished the mocha & chai exercises on #freeCodeCamp. I'm tempted to continue plowing through the rest of the exercises, but I feel like I need to go back, read some more documentation, and take some notes. I'm not fully grasping the syntax and concepts yet.

### Day 4: 
R2/D4 #100DaysOfCode
Finished reviewing and taking notes on mocha & chai. Started the #freeCodeCamp Metric-Imperial Converter project since I've covered enough to implement that one. Looks like it will be fun and should help cement what I've learned so far on this certification.

### Day 5:
R2/D5 #100DaysOfCode
Worked on the #freeCodeCamp Metric Imperial converter project. Implemented a lot of the logic for parsing the input, and a few of the tests with chai. Also wrapped up a really fun project at work where I got to solve a big challenge with SQL and Autohotkey

### Day 6:
R2/D6 #100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp
Improved the input parsing and got a few more tests passing on the Metric Imperial converter project. Also played some Code Combat for the first time with my 9yo daughter this morning. I'm happy to say she enjoyed it almost as much as me😁

### Day 7:
R2/D7 #100DaysOfCode
Didn't have a lot of time to code today with all the presents to wrap, but I did get to work on the Metric Imperial converter a little this morning. Improved the error handling and got a couple more tests to pass. 

Merry Christmas & happy coding! 🎅🎄

### Day 8:
R2/D8 #100DaysOfCode
Implemented the functional chai tests on the Metric Imperial Converter. Improved the regex for parsing the number input some more. All my tests are finally passing. Now I'm trying to get all the #freeCodeCamp tests to pass (using community-developed tests)
