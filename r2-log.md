# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Round 2

### Day 0: 
R2/D0. I've decided it's time to start my next round of #100DaysOfCode. During this round, I want to do the #freeCodeCamp Information Security & Quality Assurance certification, work up to 3kyu on #codewar and build my own free stack application. I can't wait to get started! 

### Day 1:
R2/D1 #100DaysOfCode
Had a great first day of my 2nd round
‚óè Hosted a 2nd #HourofCode with the other 4th grade class (so much fun!)
‚óè Figured out the parsing portion of a 2kyu #codewar kata I've been working on
‚óè Completed the InfoSec Helmet & BCrypt lessons on #freeCodeCamp

### Day 2:
R2/D2 #100DaysOfCode 
Today I started learning about QA testing with mocha & chai (coincidentally while drinking some chai ‚òïÔ∏èüòÅ). Got through 20/24 of the #freeCodeCamp exercises in this section.

### Day 3:
R2/D3 #100DaysOfCode
Finished the mocha & chai exercises on #freeCodeCamp. I'm tempted to continue plowing through the rest of the exercises, but I feel like I need to go back, read some more documentation, and take some notes. I'm not fully grasping the syntax and concepts yet.

### Day 4: 
R2/D4 #100DaysOfCode
Finished reviewing and taking notes on mocha & chai. Started the #freeCodeCamp Metric-Imperial Converter project since I've covered enough to implement that one. Looks like it will be fun and should help cement what I've learned so far on this certification.

### Day 5:
R2/D5 #100DaysOfCode
Worked on the #freeCodeCamp Metric Imperial converter project. Implemented a lot of the logic for parsing the input, and a few of the tests with chai. Also wrapped up a really fun project at work where I got to solve a big challenge with SQL and Autohotkey

### Day 6:
R2/D6 #100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp
Improved the input parsing and got a few more tests passing on the Metric Imperial converter project. Also played some Code Combat for the first time with my 9yo daughter this morning. I'm happy to say she enjoyed it almost as much as meüòÅ

### Day 7:
R2/D7 #100DaysOfCode
Didn't have a lot of time to code today with all the presents to wrap, but I did get to work on the Metric Imperial converter a little this morning. Improved the error handling and got a couple more tests to pass. 

Merry Christmas & happy coding! üéÖüéÑ

### Day 8:
R2/D8 #100DaysOfCode
Implemented the functional chai tests on the Metric Imperial Converter. Improved the regex for parsing the number input some more. All my tests are finally passing. Now I'm trying to get all the #freeCodeCamp tests to pass (using community-developed tests)

### Day 9:
R2/D9 #100DaysOfCode 
Got all the tests to pass, polished up, and submitted the Metric Imperial Converter ‚úÖ That's 1 of 5 projects complete for the Infosec & QA #freeCodeCamp certification üòÑ

### Day 10: 
R2/D10 #100DaysOfCode
Got started on my next #freeCodeCamp project, the Issue Tracker. Got all the packages and Mongo DB set up. Tried multiple ways to add an express route only once the db connected, but couldn't get it. Finally had to give in and leave it for tomorrowüòå

### Day 11:
R2/D11 #100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp
Got MongoDB connected on my Issue Tracker. Implemented saving new issues to the database and retrieving via GET request. Got 5 of the FCC tests passing. Glad to end the year with a productive coding sessionüòä Happy New Year everyone! üéâü•≥

### Day 12:
R2/D12 #100DaysOfCode
Implemented the express routes for modifying, deleting, and filtering issues on the #freeCodeCamp Issue Tracker project. Got 5 more FCC tests passing. Man I love the feeling I get after a productive coding session!üòÅo

![10 FCC tests passing on the Issue Tracker](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ENUOwu2WkAA4Jna?format=png&name=small)

### Day 13:
R2/D13 #100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp
Wrote all the functional chai tests and got the last 5 FCC tests to pass on my Issue Tracker. Just need to do a little polishing and I'll be done with this one üòÅ

### Day 14:
R2/D14 #100DaysOfCode
Polished up and submitted my #freeCodeCamp Issue Tracker project. 2 down, 3 to go on my Info Security & QA certificationüòä

### Day 15:
R2/D15 #100DaysOfCode
Got a good start on my next #freeCodeCamp project, the Personal Library. Set up the Glitch project, the MongoDB, and implemented express routes for posting and getting books. Got the first 4 of the FCC tests to pass.

### Day 16:
R2/D16 #100DaysOfCode 
Finished implementing the post, get, and delete routes for the #freeCodeCamp Personal Library project and got all the related tests to pass (10/16 so far). Learned how to hide fields (like \_\_v) returned by mongoose in JSON.

### Day 17:
R2/D17 #100DaysOfCode
I'm getting much better at coding functional tests with chai thanks to all the repetition. Today I implemented all the functional tests, got all the FCC tests to pass, and finished the #freeCodeCamp Personal Library project. 3 down 2 more to goüòÅ

### Day 18:
R2/D18 #100DaysOfCode
Got started on the #freeCodeCamp Stock Checker app. Learned how to use composite unique indexes to prevent duplicates in MongoDB. Got 4/6 of the tests to pass. This one's pretty interesting - combining a db with an existing API to track likes.

### Day 19:
R2/D19 #100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp
Spent a lot of time today trying to understand how to handle db errors. Learned how to set up error-handling middleware and catch, modify, and re-throw errors to parent functions. My code seems much more graceful and less repetitive now üòé

### Day 20:
R2/D20 #100DaysOfCode 
Implemented the comparison functionality and all of the functional tests on my Stock Checker #freeCodeCamp app. Got 5 out of 6 of the FCC tests to pass, but I'm not sure why the 6th one won't. I'll have to dig into it more tomorrow üòï

### Day 21:
R2/D21
Got the stomach bug yesterdayüòî, but managed to work on the error in the FCC Backend Tester. Found and fixed several bugs and got all the Stock Checker tests to pass! It was a great experience working on someone else's code for the first time
\#100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp

### Day 22:
R2/D22
Finished up and submitted the Stock Price Checker app. 4 down, only 1 to go! Started going through the remaining Advanced Node & Express exercises on FCC before I tackle the last project.

### Day 23:
R2/D23
Worked through more of the authentication exercises and started this excellent video by @traversymedia, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FOq4cUdH8k&t=3547s which made it so much easier to understand. Getting excited about being able to implement authentication in my apps.
\#100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp

### Day 24:
R2/D24
Spent an hour trying to get the GitHub authentication exercises to pass on #freeCodeCamp, only to figure out I was supposed to use a different boilerplate, not make all these unnecessary changes to my current one!üò¨ 
\#100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp

### Day 25:
R2/D25
Got the social authentication challenges to complete (thanks to using the right boilerplate this time)! Learned how to look up the assertions for the FCC tests in GitHub, and fixed a couple tests that weren't passing. Started socket exercises.
\#100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp

### Day 26:
R2/D26
Went back and polished up my Random Quote Machine project and shared it with friends on Facebook. I'd love to create more apps as I'm learning that friends & family will find useful. Anyone have any suggestions or tips on doing that?
\#100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp

### Day 27:
R2/D27
Finished up the socket-io exercises on #freeCodeCamp. It was pretty cool learning how to build a little chat app using sockets. Started building the last of the 5 projects for the InfoSec & QA certification projects - the message board.
\#100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp

### Day 28:
R2/D28
Got the db, first route, and 4 tests working on the Message Board project. I've been looking into some cool #CodeForGood sites. Think I might sign up for this one, which looks cool: https://www.agileventures.org/. Anyone have any experience with it?
\#100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp

### Day 29:
R2/D29
Finished implementing the GET and POST routes for the Message Board app. Got the first 7 tests to pass. Learned how to limit the number of subdocuments returned and also exclude certain fields from them in mongoose. Really enjoying the backend!
\#100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp

### Day 30:
R2/D30
Implemented the PUT and DELETE routes to update and delete threads and replies on the Message Board app. Now passing 15/16 tests. All that's left is to implement the functional tests tomorrowüòÄ
\#100DaysOfCode #freeCodeCamp

### Day 31
R2/31
Implemented functional tests using mocha & chai for the 'thread' routes of my #freeCodeCamp Message Board project. Now all I have left is to do a similar set of tests for the 'replies' route tomorrow and I should be about done with this one!
