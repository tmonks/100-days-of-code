# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Round 2

### Day 0: 
R2/D0. I've decided it's time to start my next round of #100DaysOfCode. During this round, I want to do the #freeCodeCamp Information Security & Quality Assurance certification, work up to 3kyu on #codewar and build my own free stack application. I can't wait to get started! 

### Day 1:
R2/D1 #100DaysOfCode
Had a great first day of my 2nd round
‚óè Hosted a 2nd #HourofCode with the other 4th grade class (so much fun!)
‚óè Figured out the parsing portion of a 2kyu #codewar kata I've been working on
‚óè Completed the InfoSec Helmet & BCrypt lessons on #freeCodeCamp

### Day 2:
R2/D2 #100DaysOfCode 
Today I started learning about QA testing with mocha & chai (coincidentally while drinking some chai ‚òïÔ∏èüòÅ). Got through 20/24 of the #freeCodeCamp exercises in this section.

### Day 3:
R2/D3 #100DaysOfCode
Finished the mocha & chai exercises on #freeCodeCamp. I'm tempted to continue plowing through the rest of the exercises, but I feel like I need to go back, read some more documentation, and take some notes. I'm not fully grasping the syntax and concepts yet.

### Day 4: 
R2/D4 #100DaysOfCode
Finished reviewing and taking notes on mocha & chai. Started the #freeCodeCamp Metric-Imperial Converter project since I've covered enough to implement that one. Looks like it will be fun and should help cement what I've learned so far on this certification.
