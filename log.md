# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 21, Wednesday
I'm finally committing to #100DaysOfCode. My primary goals are to complete the @freeCodeCamp Front-End Libraries certification, to learn to write useful web apps, and to get more involved in the community. Looking forward to coding along side you all!


### Day 1: August 22, Thursday
Nearly finished with tweaking the layout of my Random Quote Machine @freeCodeCamp project. Hoping I get better and faster at design over time. Right now it feels totally like trial & error - I just keep trying different things until it doesn't look awful


### Day 2: August 23, Friday
Nearly finished with my Random Quote Machine project. Improved handling of empty quote string using conditional rendering. Spent WAY too much time deciding on the hover effect for my buttons, but loving CSS transitions! #freeCodeCamp


### Day 3: August 25, Sunday
Figured out how to publish my React app using GitHub Pages. I'm feeling good about learning git and moving to GitHub for my #freeCodeCamp projects. Much more intimidating than Codepen, but I think it's important to learn and it's starting to make sense


### Day 4: August 26, Monday
Polished up my code and made one last tweak to the button hover effect (last time, for real!). Did some testing in other browsers. Learned about polyfill for Promise support in IE, and that Firefox & IE don't support CSS transition on background-image :-\

I loved the idea of a rotating background image for my Random Quote Machine project, but I'm not sure if it will be too bandwidth-intensive? All 6 images are <800KB combined.

### Day 5: August 27, Tuesday
Learned how to downgrade packages and resolve security vulnerabilities in npm

I could keep tweaking my Random Quote Machine project for weeks, but calling it good enough and moving on to the next one. Pretty happy with how it turned out.  #freeCodeCamp 


### Day 6: August 28, Wednesday
Had a productive day making a few last tweaks to my Random Quote Machine project. Implemented an initial loading message. Used git branching for the first time. Got IE11 working. Used the excellent @tinyjpg to compress my background images


### Day 7: August 29, Thursday
I'm excited to have gotten a great start on my Markdown Previewer #freeCodeCamp project today. Set up create-react-app, reactstrap, & git repository. Created a rough outline, and got a controlled input working for the Markdown input.


### Day 8: August 30, Friday
More progress on my #freeCodeCamp Markdown Previewer. Added the react-fcctest and marked.js libraries and got all the tests passing! Even used DOMPurify to protect against XSS attacks. Now I just need to make the code and the UI much prettier!

**Thoughts:** Really happy with how this is progressing. Only 2 days (couple hours) in, and I've already got most of the functionality done!

### Day 9: August 31, Saturday
Had the best time coding at Barnes & Noble while my wife shopped :-) There's nothing like coding with good coffee and good music. Got the design of my Markdown Previewer looking okay #reactjs #freeCodeCampo

### Day 10: September 2, Monday
Did lots of fun things with the kids this weekend, but was able to fit in an hour of coding last night. I struggled for a frustratingly long time with making the layout for my #freeCodeCamp Markdown Previewer full-height but without having a scroll bar! After lots of searching and trial & error, i think I finally have a handle on it.

I realized two things: 
-'height: 100%' means 100% of the parent's height, even if there's a sibling element with a fixed height (like a navbar). 
- By default, height is based on the height of content inside the element. To set it to anything less, you have to set the parent to a specific height (e.g. px, not %). [Why doesn't percentage height work](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5657964/css-why-doesn-t-percentage-height-work)

### Day 11: September 3, Tuesday
Struggled a little more with the full-height-without-scrollbar layout on my Markdown Previewer, but got it working. Tracked down the problem with navbar dark not having a white font. Getting better at tracking these things down in the Chrome Developer console!

### Day 12: September 4, Wednesday
Nearly done with my #freeCodeCamp Markdown Previewer. Made a few more improvements to the styling (textarea & title). Improved the sample markdown. Took a few notes to so I would remember the new things I learned. Should be able to finish it up and submit it tomorrow.
